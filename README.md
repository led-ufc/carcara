# carcara

**carcara** is City Information Modeling research project. Here we share some definitions for Grasshopper 3D for retrieve data from geodatabases. The definitions are formated as "User Objects" to make it easier to use. 

We are in our beta 2 version. All the dependencies and user objects can be downloaded automatically with our instalation file. **Take into account that the instalation file will replace any existant folder called carcara inside your user objects folder. If you want to preserve any previous version, rename de folder before proceeding with the new instalation.**

The plugin is fully compatible with rhino 8 and utilizes a mix of python 3 and c# definitions.
